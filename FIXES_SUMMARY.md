# File Synchronization System - Fixes Summary

## üéØ Issues Resolved

### 1. **React Key Duplication Warnings** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Console showing "Encountered two children with the same key" errors in SyncVisualization component

**Solution**: 
- Completely rewrote `dashboard/src/components/SyncVisualization.jsx`
- Implemented unique key generation using `${event.event_id}-${new Date(event.timestamp).getTime()}`
- Added proper event validation (`if (!event?.event_id || !event?.data) return`)
- Fixed AnimatePresence key props throughout the component
- Improved sync state management with Map data structure

### 2. **File Synchronization Issues** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Files not properly synchronizing between nodes after upload

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `_propagate_file_to_nodes()` method in `coordinator/server.py`
- Added actual file replication instead of simulation
- Created replica metadata for each target node with unique paths
- Implemented proper progress tracking (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Added file version storage using `file_manager.create_version()`
- Added realistic timing with 0.3s delays between progress updates

### 3. **Node Removal Functionality** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Missing ability to remove nodes from the system

**Solution**:
- Added `remove_node()` method to DatabaseManager class in `coordinator/database.py`
- Method performs cascading deletes across nodes, events, network_metrics, and conflicts tables
- Added `nodeApi.remove()` function to `dashboard/src/utils/api.js`
- Enhanced NodeManager.jsx component with:
  - `handleRemoveNode()` function with confirmation dialog
  - Remove button next to each node with proper styling
  - Disabled state handling during operations
  - Integration with refresh callbacks

### 4. **Event System and Unique IDs** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Events lacking proper unique identifiers causing React rendering issues

**Solution**:
- Enhanced event ID generation in shared/models.py
- Fixed event type matching (FILE_SYNC_PROGRESS vs file_sync_progress)
- Added proper data validation and null checking
- Improved error handling with proper event broadcasting

### 5. **Missing NodeInfo.name Field** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: NodeInfo model missing name field causing server errors

**Solution**:
- Added `name: str = ""` field to NodeInfo class in `shared/models.py`
- Updated coordinator server to properly pass name during node registration
- Fixed SyncEventType.NODE_LEFT usage (was using non-existent NODE_DISCONNECTED)

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling throughout sync operations
- Error events now properly broadcast to connected clients
- Graceful fallbacks for failed operations

### Improved Progress Tracking
- Real-time sync progress updates (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Visual feedback for file transfers between nodes
- Proper completion notifications

### Better State Management
- Enhanced React component state management
- Proper cleanup of event listeners
- Improved WebSocket connection handling

### Database Integrity
- Cascading deletes for node removal
- Proper cleanup of associated data (events, metrics, conflicts)
- Maintained referential integrity
